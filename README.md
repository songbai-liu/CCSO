# CCSO: A Comprehensive Competitive Swarm Optimizer for Large-Scale Multiobjective Optimization
Competitive swarm optimizers (CSOs) have shown very promising search efficiency in large-scale decision space. However, they face difficulties when solving large-scale multi-/many-objective optimization problems (LMOPs), as their winner particles are selected by random pairwise competition based on only a single evaluation criterion, which does not provide diverse guidance for LMOPs. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a comprehensive competitive learning strategy for CSOs using three competition mechanisms to guide the particle search. Specifically, environmental competition classifies winner and loser particles from the swarm, while cognitive com-petition and social competition select one winner particle as the cognitive component and the social component, respectively, to guide the search for loser particles. This competitive learning strategy aims to enhance the search capability of loser particles and provides diverse search directions for solving LMOPs.
